# Simple File System

A simple file system

## Brief Into

As part of an assignment in my course Operating Systems, I designed and implemented a simple file system that can be mounted by the user under a directory in the userâ€™s machines, using C. It is a file system that works in Linux. It has a few limitations, including restricted filename lengths, limited length file extensions, no user concept, no protection among files, etc. Also mountable through FUSE.
